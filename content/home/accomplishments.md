  description: "I Learned and practiced on four classification algorithm and how they approach a task. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** literally learns by example, I applied it to *self-driving vehicle road sign recognition*. **Naive Bayes** uses principles from the field of stats to make predictions, I applied it in *suggestions of iphone like destinations*. **Logistic regression** involves fitting a curve to numeric data to make predictions about binary events, I applied in a *fundraising data*. **Classification trees** use flowchart-like structures to make decisions, I applied it in the *Lending Club data to simulate scenarios*."

  description: "Cluster analysis is used  to find groups of observations (clusters) that share similar characteristics. These similarities can inform all kinds of business decisions;  for example, in marketing, it is used to identify distinct groups of customers for which advertisements can be tailored. In this course, I learned about two commonly used clustering methods - **hierarchical clustering** and **k-means** clustering. I build a strong intuition for how they work and how to interpret their results. I developed this intuition by exploring three different data sets:* soccer player positions, wholesale customer spending data, and longitudinal occupational wage data.*"

  description: "Python is a general-purpose programming language that is becoming ever more popular for data science. Apart from me knowing R I strengthened my base in python by learning, data types; how to store, access, and manipulate data in list; functions and packages, and Numpy. **The syntax is the same as R and SQL**"

  description: "This course gave me the tools to make attractive and interactive web maps using spatial data and the tidyverse. I created maps using the **IPEDS dataset, which contains data on U.S. colleges and universities.** I mainly practiced on how to customize maps using labels, popups, and custom markers, and add layers to enhance interactivity. I am able to create and customize my own interactive web map to reveal patterns from data. "

  description: "Modeling credit risk for both personal and company loans is of major importance for financial institutions. The probability that a debtor will default is a key component in getting to a measure for credit risk. This course was very hands on with real life credit data where I modeled credit risk by using **logistic regression and decision trees** in R."

  description: "As an aspiring data professional, I build R skills that I were necessary to succeed as a data scientist. I learned how to import, clean, manipulate, and visualize data. Through interactive exercises, I got hands on with world data sets to understand **statistical and machine learning techniques**. This is where I began my journey to becoming a confident data scientist. I consider it a Master degree in data science because it took me an average of 2 years to complete."

  description: "Being able to write my own functions makes my analyses more readable, with fewer errors, and more reusable from project to project. learning this skill increased my productivity more than any other skill! The real world data sets I used in course are **Wyoming tourism, stock price/earnings ratios, and grain yields**."

  description: "Many times in machine learning, the goal is to find patterns in data without trying to make predictions. This is called unsupervised learning. One common use case of unsupervised learning is grouping consumers based on demographics and purchasing history to deploy targeted marketing campaigns. Another example is wanting to describe the unmeasured factors that most influence crime differences between cities. I learned **clustering (K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, and PCA) and dimensionality reduction** from a machine learning perspective. "

  description: "Dates and times are abundant in data and essential for answering questions that start with when, how long, or how often.
